# Nat MacMillan Mini Data Analysis Project

This is the repository for my data analysis project on trees in Vancouver, where I will be applying tools learned in STAT 545 to a dataset. The aim of this assignment was to practice data analysis skills using the R packages **ggplot2** and **dplyr**. For this project, I was mainly exploring how different variables from the dataset interacted with tree size.

### Folders
In this Github Repository I have created/modified the following folders and files
1. Milestone1
* Milestone1_files/figures-gfm: figures from the .rmd file
* milestone1.rmd: orginial file edited that contains the code for this project
* milestone1.md: markdown file knitted from mileston1.rmd
* README.md: basic description of the folder
3. Milestone 2
* Milestone2_files/figures-gfm: figures from the .rmd file
* milestone2.rmd: orginial file edited that contains the code for this project
* milestone2.md: markdown file knitted from mileston1.rmd
* README.md: basic description of the folder
4. Output
* Model1.rds: linear model created in Milestone 2
* biggest_trees.csv: .csv file created from Milestone 2 looking at the summary statistics for diameter of tree by neighborhood
* README.md: basic description of folder

#### Readme File
This is the Readme File. 

### How to intereact with this project
The .rmd files can be seen on Github or in RStudio. Packages **datateacher** and **tidyverse** will need to be installed. The .md files can be viewed in Github
